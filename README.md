Data Structures and Algorithms: Deep Dive Using JavaScript

To build this repository, I am/was watching and reading from the following courses/books.
- Coursera (Algorithms Part 1, Algorithm Part 2)
- Udemy [The Coding Interview Bootcamp: Algorithms + Data Structures](https://www.udemy.com/data-structures-and-algorithms-deep-dive-using-java)
- Udemy [Data Structures and Algorithms: Deep Dive Using Java](https://www.udemy.com/data-structures-and-algorithms-deep-dive-using-java)
- Udemy [Practical Data Structures & Algorithms in Java + HW](https://www.udemy.com/practical-data-structures-algorithms-in-java)
- [CLRS](https://www.amazon.ca/Introduction-Algorithms-Thomas-H-Cormen/dp/0262033844)

The goal is to practice everything in JS but I might never reach there! So, I am completing it over time.

Cheers :beers:
